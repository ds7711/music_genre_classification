CNN achieves human-level accuracy in music genre classification
This is part of the course project for Rutgers Machine Learning class (2017 Spring). 

It uses the convolutional neural network to perform music genre classification and achieves 70% accuracy. 

To run the code, one has to either download the GTZAN dataset (http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/) and convert them into mel-spectrogram (64 mel-filters), or download the already converted data .

A detailed explanation of the code is in the PDF.
